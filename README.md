# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

## Project Overview
This project segments customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. The goal is to identify high-value customers and tailor marketing strategies effectively.


## Why Use Customer Segmentation?
- **Identify Valuable Customers:** RFM analysis helps recognize the most valuable customers contributing significantly to revenue.
- **Optimize Marketing Efforts:** Tailor marketing strategies more effectively by segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior.
- **Improve Customer Retention:** Understand customers at risk of churning and take proactive steps for retention.
- **Increase Customer Lifetime Value:** Focus on high-frequency and high-monetary customers to maximize their lifetime value.

## What is Customer Segmentation?
Customer segmentation involves grouping customers based on similar characteristics:
- **Demographic Segmentation**
- **Geographic Segmentation**
- **Behavioral Segmentation**
- **Psychographic Segmentation**

## RFM Technique
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to evaluate and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior:
- **Recency (R):** Measures how recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency (F):** Measures how often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary (M):** Measures how much money a customer spends.
